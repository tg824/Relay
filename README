This is my Android application. It's meant to serve as a program that will find cancer related events,
like fundraisers, promotions, and the like.  Right now I would consider it in it's beta phase (12/29/11)
with most key features implemented.  Please go easy on me, it's my first real experience programming an 
Android application, or any mobile application for that matter.
